### Hi there 👋


Salutations and Howdy,

I'm a programmer. My expertise lies in C++, but I also program in React, Java, C, and Python. Expertise in that order. I like messing around with different coding styles, practicies, paradigms, languages, applications, etc but I can't really say I'm an expert.

🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js and Firebase.

🔭 I’m also deepening my knowledge in React and Java.

💬 Ask me about my familiarity with a technology. I've messed around quite a bit.

⚡ Fun fact: I don't have deep knowledge, but I know a little about alot of things.
