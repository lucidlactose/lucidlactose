### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


Salutations and Howdy,

I'm a programmer. My expertise lies in C++, but I also program in React, Java, C, and Python. Expertise in that order. I like messing around with different coding styles, practicies, paradigms, languages, applications, etc but I can't really say I'm an expert.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js and Firebase.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m also deepening my knowledge in React and Java.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my familiarity with a technology. I don't have projects, but I have messed around quite a bit.

âš¡ Fun fact: I mess around with music, art, and language.
