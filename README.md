### Hi there 👋


Salutations and Howdy,

I'm a programmer. My expertise lies in C++, but I also program in React, Java, C, and Python. Expertise in that order. I like messing around with different coding styles, practicies, paradigms, languages, applications, etc but I can't really say I'm an expert.

🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js and Kafka.

🔭 I’m also deepening my knowledge in React and Java.

💬 Ask me about my familiarity with a technology. I have projects, and I have messed around quite a bit.

⚡ Fun fact: I mess around with music, art, and language.

📫 Want to chat? [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesus-villarruel/) and official business here: [e-mail](mailto:jesusvillarruel98@gmail.com). Wherever else is casual.
